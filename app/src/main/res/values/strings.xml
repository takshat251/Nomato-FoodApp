    <string name="faq_answer_two">A.2 A Spoonback is an automatic link from a Nomato restaurant page to your blog post.
        You review the restaurant on your blog, and we\'ll link to your post. The link appears in a special Blogs section
        on each Nomato restaurant page, city feed, your Food Journey, your profile page, and your followers\' feeds.
    </string>
    <string name="faq_answer_four">A.4 Here at Nomato, we prominently display blogger reviews. If you use Spoonbacks, Nomato
        users will see an excerpt from your review, and a link to click through to your blog. In short, you get exposure and
        traffic to your blog for free.
    </string>
    <string name="faq_answer_three">A.3 Once you add a spoonback to your blog post, it will reflect on your Nomato profile page
        under \'Pending Posts\' within 24 hours. From here you can easily add a rating, photos, tag friends and publish your blog
        post on Nomato. If it has been significantly longer than that, please write to us at bloggerhelp@nomato.com and we\'ll
        investigate. It\'s helpful if you can provide us with links to the blog posts in question.</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_five">A.5 Top Blogger rankings are based on the number of blog posts (excerpts) that the blogger has
        published on Nomato via Spoonbacks. Note that only one blog post per restaurant is counted towards the Top Bloggers rankings.
    </string>
    <string name="faq_answer_six">A.6 We request you to claim access to food related blogs only. Our team runs a verification on all
        registered blogs and blogs which are irrelevant to the Nomato platform i.e.non-food related, or containing objectionable
        content, these are revoked.
